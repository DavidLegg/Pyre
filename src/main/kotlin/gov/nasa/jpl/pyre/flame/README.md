# Pyre - Flame

Flame is the layer of pyre responsible for the least critical components.
A modeler could reasonably be expected to build a simulation with relative ease without the components in this layer.
Nonetheless, classes in this layer demonstrate useful patterns, with an eye towards how Pyre can and should be used in practice.
