# Pyre Lander

Replicates [Aerie Lander](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/aerie-lander) in Pyre more or less verbatim.

This isn't meant to be the best way to write that model in Pyre, only to be a highly faithful translation.

This can serve as a performance and correctness test of Pyre against Aerie.
