# Pyre - Utilities

This is the lowest layer of Pyre, a general-purpose utility layer.

Utilities in this layer should be agnostic to Pyre's main purpose of being a simulator.
For example, general functional-programming utilities belong in this layer.
Put another way, utilities in this layer could reasonably be applied to any Kotlin project, and aren't specific to Pyre.
